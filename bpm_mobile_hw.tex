\begin{abstract}

The goal of our Bluetooth Parking Manager, parking lot gate opening system, is providing seamless authentication without additional user effort and additional devices. We propose to use Bluetooth technology as a communication channel with a smartphone as a control device. Given that most smartphones have embedded Bluetooth module, and most users bring their device in everyday life, especially when driving, the combination of Bluetooth with smartphone is a strong candidate for our solution. In this paper, we demonstrate that parking lot gate can be easily controlled by a smartphone using Bluetooth technology with a reasonable waiting time. We will also show that through thoroughly analyzing the signal strength of Bluetooth module, the system can verify the location of the user and eliminate possibilities of granting access to unauthorized users.
