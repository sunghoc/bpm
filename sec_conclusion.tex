\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we proposed the Bluetooth Parking Manager system that overcomes current parking lot gating system's problems. With using Bluetooth technology and Android smartphone, our system minimizes user's extra effort and lowers administrative demanding.  Also it would easily deployed on top of current parking lot system since it only needs one additional Bluetooth module, adaptation would be possible with low cost. Throughout our work, we demonstrated the seamless system works reliably and it could effectively cope with corner case problem. However, we found that currently developed system has a minor issue in user waiting time and one time pairing requirement because of Android device's limitation. Thus, we leave those topics as our future work to improve in next stage of BPM system.
